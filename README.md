# CyanoBLAST

A tool for analysing the proteome of newly discovered cyanobacterial species against the well documented, model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (PCC 6803). The analysis incorporates the use of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). In this example, we use the newly discovered, fast-growing strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901 for comparison against PCC 6803.


To compare against the well-documented PCC 6803 species, the input data was based upon the findings from Baers et al. (2019). A modified version of Supplementary Table 3 (ST3) from this paper was created and formed the starting point for all the input data required for PCC 6803’s proteome information. ADD FILE NAME OF COMPRESSED TABLE (ComparisonData.npz)


A second input file was then taken from Supplementary Tables 1, 3 or 4 found in Mills et al., these three tables are split into different class of PCC 6803’s proteome: central metabolism and transport (CentMet); characterised proteins not involved in central metabolism (Known); uncharacterised proteins (Unkown); as well as an option to compare agains all proteins (All). This requires input from the user under -c --category (see below).


Outline of CyanoBLAST.py
CyanoBLAST -i -c -o [-n] [-e] [-r] [-s] [-h] [-v]

Required:
  -i, --input_database      Path to an existing local blast database directory generated from a .faa file
                            using blast+ 'makeblastdb'. If no local database exists, one can be
                            generated by passing [ -n / --new_database ]
                        
  -c, --category            Category selection for searching proteome against local blast database.
                            Options:  all, centMet, known, unknown
                        
  -o, --output              Name of output file (*.xlsx)

Optional:
  -n, --new_database        Path to directory where the database should be built.
                            If no path is provided, default path will be used: D:\PythonScripts\Argparse_test\Lib\Databases (CHANGE?)
                            Default: None
                        
  -e, --evalue              Set the e-value to the desired number. Can be given as scientific notation ( e.g. 1e-8 )
                            Default: 1
                        
  -r, --unedited_results    Save results without colour format
                            Default: False
                            
  -s, --verbose             Print to console as program runs

Options:
  -h, --help            shows help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
